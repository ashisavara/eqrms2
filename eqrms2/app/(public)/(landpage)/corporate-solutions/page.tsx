            <Section className="py-6">
                <p>More often than not, we have noticed the following common fundamental investment errors while investing corporate funds. Here are some examples and also a glimpse into what we would do differently:</p>
                
                <div className="ime-grid-2col">
                    <AlertBox color="red" heading="Overtly conservative asset allocation">
                        <p> An over-reliance on ultra-low risk debt funds (especially liquid).</p>
                    </AlertBox>
                    <AlertBox color="green" heading="Optimal Asset Allocation">
                        <p>There is an ability to increase yields without a substantial increase in risk (via low-duration or short-duration debt funds, conservative hybrid funds or even the use of equity for longer-term goals for unlisted companies).</p>
                    </AlertBox>
                </div>

                <div className="ime-grid-2col">
                    <AlertBox color="red" heading="Sub-optimal Goal-based allocation">
                        <p> Every company has different goals and needs â€“ contingency fund, an acquisition fund, a monthly recurring expense fund, funds for specific projects etc. However often, investments are made at an overall corporate treasury level, as compared to investments against specific goals.</p>
                    </AlertBox>
                    <AlertBox color="green" heading="Investments linked to Goals">
                        <p>Keeping in mind the liquidity requirements of specific goals, we would identify investments and allocate them against each goal. This allows for substantial efficiencies in identifying the optimal investment for each goal. </p>

                        <p> Large treasuries often have too many debt funds in their portfolio, with the misconception that a larger number of funds helps reduce risk. </p>
                    </AlertBox>
                    <AlertBox color="green" heading="Optimal Diversification">
                        <p>In reality, it is better to carefully select the best high-quality low-risk debt funds and have a concentrated exposure, as compared to increasing the number of funds that forces you to include lower-quality funds in the portfolio. </p>

                    <AccordionContent>
                        <p>Your CFO / CA specialises in corporate finance, which is a different field altogether from investments. Selecting the right funds (even for low-risk debt funds) requires a careful assessment of the risk-return at a fund level (which includes analysing the individual fund holdings, understanding the trade-off between YTM &amp; risk, the different debt fund categories etc).&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Most CFO/CA&rsquo;s have a lack of time and specific expertise required for a detailed assessment of each funds suitability. This is the main reason why corporate treasuries often end-up with issues around over-diversification and overtly conservative asset allocation.</p>

                    <AccordionTrigger>Can you provide some examples of corporate financial goals?</AccordionTrigger>
                    <AccordionContent>
                        <p>The actual goals are unique to each and every company. Our advisors will help you identify the goals that are the most relevant for your specific requirements.</p>
                        <p>However, as an example, these are some of the common goals for corporates that we can help create specific plans for:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Monthly Overhead fund:</strong>&nbsp;invest idle funds in liquid debt funds with automatic redemptions prior to salary/rent payment dates</li>
                        <li><strong>Capex planning fund:</strong>&nbsp;set aside funds to be used for your next major capex requirements</li>
                        <li><strong>Contingency fund:</strong>&nbsp;you never know when cash flows can take a sudden hit. Be prepared for such contingencies and avoid being stuck at your bank&rsquo;s mercy</li>
                        <li><strong>Loan repayment fund:</strong>&nbsp;set aside money for loan repayments</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic funds:</strong>&nbsp;capital set aside to fund strategic growth opportunities (such as new business opportunities &amp; acquisitions)</li>
                        <li><strong>Contingent Liability Funds:</strong>&nbsp;set aside funds for potential unfavourable rulings on any specific contingent liability (such as tax disputes, court cases etc.)</li>

                    <AccordionTrigger>I don't wish to take risk on my corporate funds. Why do you seem to advice it?</AccordionTrigger>
                    <AccordionContent>
                        <p>It is very important to understand, that we are not recommending that you take risk with your corporate funds. Losing money in the markets that limits your ability to fund required corporate projects is the worst thing to happen for any company.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>What we are advising however, is moving away from overtly conservative corporate treasuries, that sharply reduces the returns on your funds. Specifically, we recommend:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Minimising idle funds in current accounts &amp; bank fixed deposits</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; replacing them with liquid low-risk debt funds instead</li>
                        <li><strong>Reducing over-diversification</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; to reduce the risk associated with investing in low-quality funds in an aim to diversify&nbsp;</li>
                        <li><strong>Moving away from liquid</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; whose returns have got compromised post recent regulatory changes, to liquid + fund categories (such as low-duration, ulta ST funds) which offer similar risk-return as liquid funds</li>
                        <li><strong>Consider some medium-risk investment options:&nbsp;</strong>specifically for your longer-term investment goals and if you are an unlisted family-run firm that can afford some MTM volatility risk</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>All corporate&rsquo;s will already have their fund requirements planned and it may appear that our goal planning offers nothing much incrementally from what you are currently doing. The main benefits of our financial goal planning services for corporates includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clearly documented goals:&nbsp;</strong>with fund requirements, investment horizons and risk-tolerance at a goal level</li>
                        <li><strong>Immediate visibility of funding against each goal:&nbsp;</strong>with customised reports to provide you complete clarity on how much you have invested against each bucket</li>
                        <li><strong>Goal-level investment options:&nbsp;</strong>since each goal differs in time-horizons and risk-tolerance, this helps us optimise the selection of funds for each specific goal</li>

                    <AccordionContent>
                        <p>While not strictly required (especially for smaller companies), it is recommended that all corporates (big or small) have a clearly defined investment plan that spells out the risk-appetite, core goals and allowed investment options for the corporate treasury. This plan should ideally be approved by the board (or top management), which helps provide clarity for all future investments and helps avoid too much discretion allowed at the finance level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Investment plans are dynamic, and any desired changes can always be incorporated at a future date.&nbsp;</p>

                    <AccordionContent>
                        <p>Since banks wish to push their own product, they will typically first respond in the negative when you ask about replacing bank FDs with debt MFs. However, in our experience, once pushed on the same almost all banks do allow you to substitute bank FD&rsquo;s with low-risk debt funds.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The benefit to you is the virtual elimination of taxes on investments against your funding lines.&nbsp;</p>
