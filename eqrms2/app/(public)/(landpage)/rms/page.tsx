        <p>The IME RMS is the first tool ever, to give investors direct access to the insights of the central research team. Investors gain direct access to our ratings, rating rationales & analysis across thousands of funds (MFs, PMSs, AIFs, Global funds), asset classes, categories & more.</p>
        <p>The RMS helps address one of the biggest fundamental flaws of the wealth management industry, the weak flow down of investment insights. This often leads to investors taking investment decisions with incomplete, biased or flawed insights.</p>
