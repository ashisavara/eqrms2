                    <AccordionContent>
                        <p>We offer services to investors across most geographies, with the exception of countries that are in the FATF Black-List. Countries in the FATF Grey-list, may have a more limited set of investment options available to them, and there may be requirements for some additional levels of documentation.</p>

                        <p>While most investment options (MFs, PMSs, AIFs, International) are available to investors across countries, each individual fund house can retain discretion over which regions of investors they accept funds from. This is usually not a problem for investors across the vast majority of countries. However, countries/regions that are likely to have more limited access can include USA, Canada and FATF Black/Grey Listed countries.</p>
